This object is a reminder that even the most everyday objects—a doorknob—can be crafted with beauty, meaning, and intention. It's not just a functional mechanism, it's a tiny piece of art history. The historic craftsmanship, featuring a flower-shaped backplate and intricate leaf motifs, is a perfect example of where utility meets artistry. It reflects a design sensibility from a time when even everyday objects were made with care and character. The aged brass patina and finely detailed elements invite a closer look, reminding us that beauty often lives in the small, overlooked corners of our daily spaces.
